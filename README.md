# CSharpMusicPlayer

CSharpMusicPlayer can play basic ABC music files in different temperaments.

* `Music` contains all classses relevant to storing songs.

* `MusicPlayer` contains files that are able to play music songs or other playable items. 

* `MusicParser` reads music notation, like ABC files.

If you'd like to see it in action, the Main file currently plays a song in various Pythagorean temperaments. Enjoy!
